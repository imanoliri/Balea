Balea Brewery's open business repository – full transparency on brewing ideas, finances, and operations, fostering collaboration and community-driven innovation.


## 1. Idea & Philosophy
Balea Brewery is a Basque-inspired ciderhouse, meadery, and historical brewery focused on reviving lost brewing traditions while maintaining strong cultural storytelling. The core philosophy revolves around:
- **Authenticity**: Crafting Basque-style sagardoa (cider) and mead, along with forgotten medieval fruit wines and ales.
- **Storytelling & Heritage**: Integrating Basque mythology, poetry, and history into branding, product names, and venue experience.
- **Community & Experience**: Establishing a ciderhouse/Biergarten-style venue where customers can immerse themselves in Basque culture through food, events, and workshops.
- **Open Business**: Customers and other breweries can track production, finances and decision-making, learn the recipes, propose ideas, and vote on new flavors. This approach strengthens the community and fosters collaboration and innovation.
- **Sustainability & Efficiency**: Using modern automation and only the best ingredients to maintain quality while reducing manual labor.

- **On-Site Consumption & Txotx**: A Biergarten/ciderhouse offering fresh cider, mead, and historic brews.

## 4. Business Projections
[Business_Projections spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i1qvkoGsZDia1ozenOaS76aTAC3JZTy28vB54YDQDlE/edit?usp=sharing)

In all phases, an "optimism -2" case is calculated, where the full production is realized but only 40%-50% are sold (Sales Ratio) and an "optimism -1" case, where only 40%-50% of target sales are achieved, but we reacted in time and didn't overproduce (nothing is left unsold).

The pesimistic projections are considered. If in a specific phase demand is higher than projected and we sell everything, the jump to the next phase is accelerated. The very optimistic case that we sell more than 2 whole bars is not handled, because it's outside of the scope of the business idea and definitly enough work and more than enough profit.

**Phase 0**: Research & Testing (years 0-1)
- Production: 12x60 batches/year, 720L total.
- Focus: Refining recipes, brand, and building early demand.

**Phase 1**: Pilot Launch (years 1-2)
- Production: 8x1000+1x10000 batches/year, 18,000L total.
- Focus: Biergarten opening, direct sales, and local partnerships.

**Phase 2**: Expansion (years 3-4)
- Production: 5x10000 batches/year, 50,000L total.
- Focus: Full automation & distribution, events and subscriptions.

**Phase 3**: Full Market (years 4-6)
- Production: 5x4x1000+5x2x10000 batches/year, 120,000L total.
- Focus: Full bar-level consumption. (200 seats * 3-10 barrels/seat/year*160L/barrel =100kL/year)

**Phase 4**: Full Market (years 4-6)
- Production: 12x10000+2x50000 batches/year, 220,000L total.
- Focus: Full local market saturation. (2 whole bars)
