Balea Brewery's open business repository – full transparency on brewing ideas, finances, and operations, fostering collaboration and community-driven innovation.


## 1. Idea & Philosophy
Balea Brewery is a Basque-inspired ciderhouse, meadery, and historical brewery focused on reviving lost brewing traditions while maintaining strong cultural storytelling. The core philosophy revolves around:
- **Authenticity**: Crafting Basque-style sagardoa (cider) and mead, along with forgotten medieval fruit wines and ales.
- **Storytelling & Heritage**: Integrating Basque mythology, poetry, and history into branding, product names, and venue experience.
- **Community & Experience**: Establishing a ciderhouse/Biergarten-style venue where customers can immerse themselves in Basque culture through food, events, and workshops.
- **Open Business**: Customers and other breweries can track production, finances and decision-making, see the recipes, propose ideas, and vote on new flavors. This approach strengthens the community and fosters collaboration and innovation.
- **Sustainability & Efficiency**: Using modern automation and only the best ingredients to maintain quality while reducing manual labor.
