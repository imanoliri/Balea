Balea Brewery's open business repository – full transparency on brewing ideas, finances, and operations, fostering collaboration and community-driven innovation.


## 1. Idea & Philosophy
Balea Brewery is a Basque-inspired ciderhouse, meadery, and historical brewery focused on reviving lost brewing traditions while maintaining strong cultural storytelling. The core philosophy revolves around:
- **Authenticity**: Crafting Basque-style sagardoa (cider) and mead, along with forgotten medieval fruit wines and ales.
- **Storytelling & Heritage**: Integrating Basque mythology, poetry, and history into branding, product names, and venue experience.
- **Community & Experience**: Establishing a ciderhouse/Biergarten-style venue where customers can immerse themselves in Basque culture through food, events, and workshops.
- **Open Business**: Customers and other breweries can track production, finances and decision-making, learn the recipes, propose ideas, and vote on new flavors. This approach strengthens the community and fosters collaboration and innovation.
- **Sustainability & Efficiency**: Using modern automation and only the best ingredients to maintain quality while reducing manual labor.

## 2. Business Lines
Balea Brewery operates multiple revenue streams:
- **On-Site Consumption & Txotx**: A Biergarten/ciderhouse offering fresh cider, mead, and historic brews.
- **Retail Sales & Farmer's Market**: Bottled products with a Pfand system for take-home consumption.
- **Custom Brewing for Events**: Large-batch custom brews for weddings, corporate events, and festivals.
- **Workshops & Courses**: Teaching cider and mead brewing, historical brewing techniques, and fermentation.
- **Digital Engagement**: A highly interactive website featuring an open-source business & brewing philosophy, allowing customers to access recipes, brewing logs, propose ideas and contribute to experimental batches.
- **Homebrewing Kits & Equipment**: Selling DIY brewing kits and curated ingredients.
- **Subscription Model**: Monthly "Balea Brew Box" featuring exclusive ciders, meads, and historical brews.

## 4. Business Projections
[Business_Projections spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i1qvkoGsZDia1ozenOaS76aTAC3JZTy28vB54YDQDlE/edit?usp=sharing)

In all phases, an "optimism -2" case is calculated, where the full production is realized but only 40%-50% are sold (Sales Ratio) and an "optimism -1" case, where only 40%-50% of target sales are achieved, but we reacted in time and didn't overproduce (nothing is left unsold).

The pesimistic projections are considered. If in a specific phase demand is higher than projected and we sell everything, the jump to the next phase is accelerated. The very optimistic case that we sell more than 2 whole bars is not handled, because it's outside of the scope of the business idea and definitly enough work and more than enough profit.

| Phase  | Years  | Production Target | Focus Area |
|--------|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| **0**  | 0-1    | 1,000L | Refining recipes, brand, and building early demand |
| **1**  | 1-2    | 18,000L | Biergarten opening, direct sales, and local partnerships |
| **2**  | 3-4    | 50,000L | Full operation & distribution, events and subscriptions |
| **3**  | 4-6    | 120,000L |  Full bar-level consumption (200 seats * 3-10 barrels/seat/year*160L/barrel =100kL/year) |
| **4**  | 6+     | 220,000L | Full local market saturation (2x bars) |


## 5. Recipes & Development
[Recipes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g0QLpLwEBhVCjyEvlgSv63yysXk9_XxcegWlaK4cg6A/edit?usp=sharing)

To create recipes, a spreadsheet calculator is used to determine key parameters. The process is straightforward: a liquid containing a specific amount of sugar (measured as **Original Gravity (OG)**, which represents the liquid's density relative to water) undergoes fermentation when yeast is introduced. As the yeast consumes the sugars, the **Final Gravity (FG)** decreases. For example, if a liquid starts with an OG of 1.080 and ferments down to an FG of 1.020, the difference represents the amount of sugar consumed, which in turn determines the alcohol content.


The **Alcohol by Volume (ABV)** can be calculated using the formula: <span style="background-color: #E8E8E8">_ABV(%) = (76.08 * (OG - FG) / (1.775 - OG)) * (FG / 79.4)_</span>. The **Original Gravity (OG)** itself can be estimated based on the total sugar content of the ingredients in relation to the amount of water used: <span style="background-color: #E8E8E8">_OG = 1 + Total_sugar(kg) / (Total_water(kg)*2.5)_</span>.

During fermentation, yeast will continue consuming sugars until it reaches a **Final Gravity (FG) of 1.000** (indicating no residual sugars left), unless it hits its own **alcohol tolerance limit** or is **artificially halted** through methods such as cold crashing, pasteurization, or chemical stabilization.

Beyond basic calculations, the spreadsheet also compiles essential information on yeast selection, ingredient choices and necessary equipment, which ensures a well-rounded approach to recipe formulation.
