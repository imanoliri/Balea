## Brewhouse Layout
[Brewhouse_Layout spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i1qvkoGsZDia1ozenOaS76aTAC3JZTy28vB54YDQDlE/edit?usp=sharing)

The spreadsheet is a simplified plan for the distribution of the whole brewhouse. It is only a virtual example used to experiment with the layout and the operations.

**"Brewgarden"** shows the whole venue, including a hypothetical big garden and parking lot. **"Brewery"** zooms into the terrace and proper brewhouse, defining the rooms and important parts like the taproom, sitting areas, brewing containers, storage, etc. There are some variants that consider a bigger production (suffix **"_big"**) and a more compact brewing layout that gives more internal seating space (suffix **"_compact"**).
