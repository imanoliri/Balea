## Business Projections
[Business_Projections spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i1qvkoGsZDia1ozenOaS76aTAC3JZTy28vB54YDQDlE/edit?usp=sharing)

In all phases, an "optimism -2" case is calculated, where the full production is realized but only 40%-50% are sold (Sales Ratio) and an "optimism -1" case, where only 40%-50% of target sales are achieved, but we reacted in time and didn't overproduce (nothing is left unsold).

The pesimistic projections are considered. If in a specific phase demand is higher than projected and we sell everything, the jump to the next phase is accelerated. The very optimistic case that we sell more than 2 whole bars is not handled, because it's outside of the scope of the business idea and definitly enough work and more than enough profit.

| Phase  | Years  | Production Target | Focus Area |
|--------|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| **0**  | 0-1    | 1,000L | Refining recipes, brand, and building early demand |
| **1**  | 1-2    | 18,000L | Biergarten opening, direct sales, and local partnerships |
| **2**  | 3-4    | 50,000L | Full operation & distribution, events and subscriptions |
| **3**  | 4-6    | 120,000L |  Full bar-level consumption (200 seats * 3-10 barrels/seat/year*160L/barrel =100kL/year) |
| **4**  | 6+     | 220,000L | Full local market saturation (2x bars) |
