## Operations
Operations = How the business works to turn its mission into reality.

Having defined the business idea & philosophy, business lines and product lines, we are only left to:


Define the systems and processes through which the business will operate.

This includes planning, producing, selling, and improving — everything from ingredients and recipes to customer service and bookkeeping.


### Operative steps
1. Demand & Production Forecasting
    - Scenarios per growth phase (Phase 0–3), expected batch sizes, and timelines.
    - See [Business_Projections spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i1qvkoGsZDia1ozenOaS76aTAC3JZTy28vB54YDQDlE/edit?usp=sharing)


2. Monthly Planning
    - Demand estimates → production → storage capacity → bottling/sales timing.
    - See [Brewing_Calendar spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WSErOmV3NpGC9YrrKwWCPy5YrhLJK3uXXh4-aLBEntg/edit?usp=sharing)

4. Tracking & Systems (Spreadsheets and dashboards)
    - Batches, recipes, and variants [Brewing spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g0QLpLwEBhVCjyEvlgSv63yysXk9_XxcegWlaK4cg6A/edit?usp=sharing)
    - Ingredients and suppliers
    - Storage units (by type & location)
    - Purchase logs
    - Sales logs & reports
    - Maintenance or cleaning schedules


* Other aspects:
    - Quality Assurance (QA): How you ensure each batch meets expectations (customer satisfaction forms, customer voting, taste tests, microbial checks, etc.)
    - Inventory Management: Thresholds for reordering ingredients, bottle stock, etc. (pull system)
    - Supply Chain: Contracts, delivery times, preferred vendors, logistics of getting your stuff. (just ebay is probably enough)
    - Customer Relationship Management (CRM): Keeping track of orders, preferences, subscriptions, event attendees, feedback.
    - Employee Onboarding & SOPs: how to train people, define roles, standardize service. (github, website and procedures is enough)
    - Automation & Tools: What tasks are automated? What platforms do you use (e.g., Notion, Excel, Zapier, brewery management tools)?
    - Legal & Compliance: Taxes, Pfand system logistics, alcohol licenses, labeling rules, food safety requirements.
    - Feedback & Continuous Improvement: System to analyze what works, what doesn’t, and adapt (maybe integrated into your open-source/community system).
