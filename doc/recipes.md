To create recipes, a spreadsheet calculator is used to determine key parameters. The process is straightforward: a liquid containing a specific amount of sugar (measured as **Original Gravity (OG)**, which represents the liquid's density relative to water) undergoes fermentation when yeast is introduced. As the yeast consumes the sugars, the **Final Gravity (FG)** decreases. For example, if a liquid starts with an OG of 1.080 and ferments down to an FG of 1.020, the difference represents the amount of sugar consumed, which in turn determines the alcohol content.


The **Alcohol by Volume (ABV)** can be calculated using the formula: <span style="background-color: #E8E8E8">_ABV(%) = (76.08 * (OG - FG) / (1.775 - OG)) * (FG / 79.4)_</span>. The **Original Gravity (OG)** itself can be estimated based on the total sugar content of the ingredients in relation to the amount of water used: <span style="background-color: #E8E8E8">_OG = 1 + Total_sugar(kg) / (Total_water(kg)*2.5)_</span>.

During fermentation, yeast will continue consuming sugars until it reaches a **Final Gravity (FG) of 1.000** (indicating no residual sugars left), unless it hits its own **alcohol tolerance limit** or is **artificially halted** through methods such as cold crashing, pasteurization, or chemical stabilization.

Beyond basic calculations, the spreadsheet also compiles essential information on yeast selection, ingredient choices and necessary equipment, which ensures a well-rounded approach to recipe formulation.
