	<p>The spreadsheet is a simplified plan for the distribution of the whole brewhouse. It is only a virtual example used to experiment with the layout and the operations.</p>
	
	<p><strong>&quot;Brewgarden&quot;</strong> shows the whole venue, including a hypothetical big garden and parking lot. <strong>&quot;Brewery&quot;</strong> zooms into the terrace and proper brewhouse, defining the rooms and important parts like the taproom, sitting areas, brewing containers, storage, etc. There are some variants that consider a bigger production (suffix <strong>&quot;_big&quot;</strong>) and a more compact brewing layout that gives more internal seating space (suffix <strong>&quot;_compact&quot;</strong>).</p>
