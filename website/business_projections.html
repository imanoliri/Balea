	<p>In all phases, an &quot;optimism -2&quot; case is calculated, where the full production is realized but only 40%-50% are sold (Sales Ratio) and an &quot;optimism -1&quot; case, where only 40%-50% of target sales are achieved, but we reacted in time and didn't overproduce (nothing is left unsold).</p>
	<p>The pesimistic projections are considered. If in a specific phase demand is higher than projected and we sell everything, the jump to the next phase is accelerated. The very optimistic case that we sell more than 2 whole bars is not handled, because it's outside of the scope of the business idea and definitly enough work and more than enough profit.</p>
