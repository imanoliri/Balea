	<p>Here is a table summarizing the projections for the different phases of the business.</p>

	
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Phase</th>
				<th>Years</th>
				<th>Production Target</th>
				<th>Focus Area</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td><strong>0</strong></td>

				<td>1,000L</td>
				<td>Refining recipes, brand, and building early demand</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>

	<p>For each phase, two pessimistic scenarios are considered:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>
	<p>In the <strong>&quot;optimism -2&quot;</strong> case, full production is carried out, but only 40–50% of the product is sold (low sales ratio), leaving significant surplus.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In the <strong>&quot;optimism -1&quot;</strong> case, only 40–50% of the target sales are achieved, but we anticipated the drop in demand and adjusted production accordingly—so we only produced what we sold.</p>
	</li>
	</ul>	
	
	<p>If actual <strong>demand exceeds expectations</strong> and we sell out, the transition to the next phase is triggered. However, extremely optimistic scenarios—such as selling more than two full bars’ worth of product—are not planned for, as they exceed the scope of the business idea and would already represent more than sufficient success and workload.</p>
