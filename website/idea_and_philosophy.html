	<h2 id="idea--philosophy">Idea &amp; Philosophy</h2>
	<p>Balea Brewery is a Basque-inspired ciderhouse, meadery, and historical brewery focused on reviving lost brewing traditions while maintaining strong cultural storytelling. The core philosophy revolves around:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Authenticity</strong>: Crafting Basque-style sagardoa (cider) and mead, along with forgotten medieval fruit wines and ales.</li>
	<li><strong>Storytelling &amp; Heritage</strong>: Integrating Basque mythology, poetry, and history into branding, product names, and venue experience.</li>
	<li><strong>Community &amp; Experience</strong>: Establishing a ciderhouse/Biergarten-style venue where customers can immerse themselves in Basque culture through food, events, and workshops.</li>
	<li><strong>Open Business</strong>: Customers and other breweries can track production, finances and decision-making, learn the recipes, propose ideas, and vote on new flavors. This approach strengthens the community and fosters collaboration and innovation.</li>
	<li><strong>Sustainability &amp; Efficiency</strong>: Using modern automation and only the best ingredients to maintain quality while reducing manual labor.</li>
	</ul>
