	<p>To create recipes, a spreadsheet calculator is used to determine key parameters. The process is straightforward: a liquid containing a specific amount of sugar (measured as <strong>Original Gravity (OG)</strong>, which represents the liquid's density relative to water) undergoes fermentation when yeast is introduced. As the yeast consumes the sugars, the <strong>Final Gravity (FG)</strong> decreases. For example, if a liquid starts with an OG of 1.080 and ferments down to an FG of 1.020, the difference represents the amount of sugar consumed, which in turn determines the alcohol content.</p>
	<p>The <strong>Alcohol by Volume (ABV)</strong> can be calculated using the formula: <span style="background-color: #E8E8E8"><em>ABV(%) = (76.08 * (OG - FG) / (1.775 - OG)) * (FG / 79.4)</em></span>. The <strong>Original Gravity (OG)</strong> itself can be estimated based on the total sugar content of the ingredients in relation to the amount of water used: <span style="background-color: #E8E8E8"><em>OG = 1 + Total_sugar(kg) / (Total_water(kg)*2.5)</em></span>.</p>
	<p>During fermentation, yeast will continue consuming sugars until it reaches a <strong>Final Gravity (FG) of 1.000</strong> (indicating no residual sugars left), unless it hits its own <strong>alcohol tolerance limit</strong> or is <strong>artificially halted</strong> through methods such as cold crashing, pasteurization, or chemical stabilization.</p>
	<p>Beyond basic calculations, the spreadsheet also compiles essential information on yeast selection, ingredient choices and necessary equipment, which ensures a well-rounded approach to recipe formulation.</p>
